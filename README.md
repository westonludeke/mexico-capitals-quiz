# Mexico Capitals Quiz

## What this is:

A simple quiz in JavaScript on the capitals of the 31 Mexican states. I built this project to learn two dimensional arrays as part of the Treehouse "Beginning JavaScript" course. [You can click here to view the project live, via GitHub Pages](https://westonludeke.github.io/mexico-capitals-quiz/)

## More:

The ["Beginning JavaScript"](https://teamtreehouse.com/tracks/beginning-javascript) course in Treehouse section on ["Two-Dimensional Arrays"](https://teamtreehouse.com/library/twodimensional-arrays) asked users to create a simple quiz ["Build a Quiz Challenge, Part 1"](https://teamtreehouse.com/library/build-a-quiz-challenge-part-1) and loop through the quiz.

I decided to take things a little further and turned the simple quiz I built into a full-blown web based quiz app in JavaScript, quizzing the user on the capitals of Mexico's 31 states. 

In addition to learning web development, I'm also learning Spanish and I've worked hard to learn more about Mexico and it's history. I've used Quizlet to learn the 31 Mexican states and it's capitals, so it was fun building out essentially the same version of the same quiz I've been using on Quizlet.
